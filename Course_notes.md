## Overall points

* Game theory centers on equilibrium concepts
* Equilibrium concepts help us reason about “how we think a game might be played”
* The idea in every equilibrium concept is that **if** players believe others play according to
the specification in an equilibrium, **then** they have no incentive to deviate from the
equilibrium themselves
* Every equilibrium concept requires both strategies (a specification of what the player will
do), and either implicitly or explicitly, their beliefs (what they think other players will do)
* In an equilibrium, beliefs have to be consistent and strategies have to be optimal:
  * Players have to have beliefs that are consistent with other players’ strategies;
and
  * Players’ strategies have to be best responses given their beliefs
